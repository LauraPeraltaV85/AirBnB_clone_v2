# Airbnb clone HBNB

Airbnb is a web platform to rent house, rooms and more. This is the first step \
to clone it. In this step we did a console to manage the objects created by the\
 classes to do easier the way to add, del, destroy and update objects. Also we \
use a file JSON to store and persist objects. and obviusly we created our data \
model.

### Supported classes:
* BaseModel
* User
* State
* City
* Amenity
* Place
* Review

### Commands:
* create - create an object
* show - show an object (based on id)
* destroy - destroy an object
* all - show all objects, of one type or all types
* quit/EOF - quit the console
* help - see descriptions of commands

To start, navigate to the project folder and enter `./console.py` in the shell.
